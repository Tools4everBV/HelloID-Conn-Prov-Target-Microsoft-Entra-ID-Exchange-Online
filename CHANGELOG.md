# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [2.5.5] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **correlateOnly/delete.ps1**: Added support for deleting cloud-only accounts via Reconciliation. The script validates that accounts are not synchronized from on-premises Active Directory before allowing deletion.
- **correlateOnly/disable.ps1**: Added support for disabling cloud-only accounts via Reconciliation. The script validates that accounts are not synchronized from on-premises Active Directory before allowing the disable action.
- **correlateOnly/fieldMapping.json**: Added `onPremisesSyncEnabled` as a read-only attribute to determine whether an account is synchronized from on-premises AD. This attribute is used by the delete and disable scripts to prevent actions on synced accounts.

### Changed
- **correlateOnly**: Delete and disable actions now only execute when triggered from Reconciliation (`$actionContext.Origin -eq 'Reconciliation'`). Regular provisioning flows are unaffected.

### Fixed
- Manager not found catch was not working when running the connector on-prem (PSv5)

## [2.5.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where import scripts without field mapping added a trailing whitespace character to `accountEnabled`.

## [2.5.3] - 04-08-2026

### Added
- Import examples how to filter data for account and memberships

### Fixed
- Added private key check in scripts where it was missing

### Changed
- Empty or whitespace `department` values are now converted to `$null`, allowing the field to be cleared correctly instead of placing a whitespace.

## [2.5.2] - 30-07-2026
### Fixed
- **correlateOnly/create.ps1**: Changed correlation value from `accountFieldValue` to `personFieldValue` to support Governance correlation scenarios correctly.
- **create.ps1**: Fixed Exchange mailbox creation to use `mailNickName` for the `Name` parameter (which must be unique) and added explicit `DisplayName` parameter. This resolves errors when creating mailboxes for users with duplicate display names.
- **permissions/emailAuthenticationMethods/grantPermission.ps1**: Changed email authentication method to use personal email address instead of business email address. This ensures password reset codes are sent to an accessible email address rather than the business account being reset.
- **permissions/groups/subPermissions.ps1**: Fixed undefined `$resource` variable in `$actionMessage`. The message now correctly displays `$correlationField`, `$correlationValue`, and `$contract.ExternalId` for improved logging clarity.

### Added
- **correlateOnly/fieldMapping.json**: Added `userPrincipalName` as an additional correlation field alongside `employeeId`, enabling environments to correlate on either attribute as needed.

## [2.5.1] - 30-07-2026
### Fixed
- **uniquenessCheck.ps1**: Fixed bug where email addresses were incorrectly flagged as non-unique during `create` operations, even when the person was already using that email address themselves. The script now properly performs correlation lookup (employeeId → givenName fallback) during create to identify if the account already exists, and correctly checks self-usage across all operation types.

### Changed
- **uniquenessCheck.ps1**: Added explicit `$correlationField` and `$entraMailboxFallbackLookupPropertyValue` variables for consistency with `create.ps1`.

### Added
- **README.md**: Added documentation explaining that correlation configuration must be manually updated in `uniquenessCheck.ps1` when using different correlation fields, as `$actionContext.CorrelationConfiguration` is not available in the uniqueness check lifecycle action.
