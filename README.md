## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Exchange-Online_ is a _target_ connector. _MS-Entra-Exo_ provides a set of REST API's that allow you to programmatically interact with its data.

The _HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Exchange-Online_ connector supports both _Microsoft Entra_ combined with _Microsoft Exchange Online_, as well as standalone _Microsoft Entra_ environments. Integration with _Exchange Online_ can be enabled via the configuration by toggling the `Exchange Online integration` option.

> [!NOTE]
> When using MS Exchange Online, please note that licensing must be configured separately, through group-based licensing.

## Getting started

### Requirements

#### App Registration & Certificate Setup

Before implementing this connector, make sure to configure a Microsoft Entra ID, an App Registration. During the setup process, you’ll create a new App Registration in the Entra portal, assign the necessary API permissions (such as user and group read/write), and generate and assign a certificate.

Follow the official Microsoft documentation for creating an App Registration and setting up certificate-based authentication:
- [App-only authentication with certificate (Exchange Online)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#set-up-app-only-authentication)

#### HelloID-specific configuration

Once you have completed the Microsoft setup and followed their best practices, configure the following HelloID-specific requirements.

- **API Permissions** (Application permissions):
  - `User.ReadWrite.All`
  - `Group.ReadWrite.All`
  - `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`
  - `UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All`
  - `User.EnableDisableAccount.All`
  - `User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All`
  - `User-Phone.ReadWrite.All`
- **Exchange Online permissions:**
  - `Exchange.ManageAsApp` (Office 365 Exchange Online)
- **Entra ID Role assignment:**
  - Assign the **Exchange Recipient Administrator** role to the App Registration
- **Certificate:**
  - Upload the public key file (.cer) in Entra ID
  - Provide the certificate as a Base64 string in HelloID. For instructions on creating the certificate and obtaining the base64 string, refer to our forum post: [Setting up a certificate for Microsoft Graph API in HelloID connectors](https://forum.helloid.com/forum/helloid-provisioning/5338-instruction-setting-up-a-certificate-for-microsoft-graph-api-in-helloid-connectors#post5338)

### Correlation configuration

The correlation configuration is used to specify which properties will be used to match an existing account within _MS-Entra-Exo_ to a person in _HelloID_.

| Setting                   | Value                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Enable correlation        | `True`                            |
| Person correlation field  | `PersonContext.Person.ExternalId` |
| Account correlation field | `EmployeeId`                      |

> [!TIP]
> _For more information on correlation, please refer to our correlation [documentation](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/target-systems/powershell-v2-target-systems/correlation.html) pages_.

### Field mapping

The field mapping can be imported by using the _fieldMapping.json_ file.

## Remarks

### Correlation value

Initial correlation is based on the `EmployeeId` with a fall back to `GivenName` and `FirstName`. See also: [Fall back property.](#fallback-property-exo-only)

#### Fallback property (ExO only)

A fallback is necessary because when creating an account using `New-Mailbox`, it’s not possible to immediately set the correlation value.
Therefore, when the account is created, the correlation value (employeeId) is temporarily placed in the `GivenName`/`FirstName` field.
Afterward, a separate action is performed to correctly set the correlation value and restore the `FirstName` to the correct value.

A create of an EXO account consists of 4 or 5 actions:
- `CreateAccountExo`
- `UpdateAccountEntraCorrelationValueAfterCreateMailbox`
- `UpdateAccountExo`
- `UpdateAccountEntra`
- `SetManager` (optional)

`UpdateAccountExo` has a retry mechanism with 5 attempts, because it can happen that the account is not immediately found after it’s created. (This problem does not occur within MS Entra).

If one of these individual action fails, the entire create operation fails. During a retry, a normal correlation attempt is first made. If no match is found, the script tries to find the account based on the `FirstName`, where the correlation value was temporarily stored earlier. If an account is found using this fallback method, the script treats it as a create operation rather than a correlate. It then performs the same actions as a regular create, except for executing `New-Mailbox`.

Fall back must be configured within the _create_ lifecycle action.

```powershell
# Script Configuration, only Required for ExchangeOnlineIntegration.
# Note that the property name should be the same! The givenName in Entra corresponds to FirstName in EXO.
$entraMailboxFallbackLookupProperty = 'givenName'
$exchangeMailboxFallbackLookupProperty = 'FirstName'
```

#### properties without the exchangeOnline prefix

Mapped properties without the `exchangeOnline` prefix are updated through _GraphAPI_.

#### Hardcoded boolean values

In the field mapping, we use one example property: `HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled`. This property is a boolean, and its value is hardcoded in the code for conversion.
**Note:** `Set-Mailbox` does **not** accept a string like "true" as a valid boolean value.

When adding an Exchange property to the field mapping, you will need to update the code to convert the string to a boolean. (It might be possible to make this conversion dynamic in the future.)

#### Hardcoded mapping

To create an EXO account, a hardcoded mapping is used in the code. This ensures consistency in the field mapping by following the field names of the Graph API. Without this, you would encounter duplicate mappings with identical values.

The code example below demonstrates this mapping:

```powershell
$createExoAccountSplatParams = @{
    Alias                     = $actionContext.Data.mailNickName
    Name                      = $actionContext.Data.displayName
    PrimarySmtpAddress        = ($actionContext.Data.exchangeOnline.emailAddresses | Where-Object { $_ -cmatch '^SMTP:' } | Select-Object -First 1) -replace 'SMTP:', ''
    MicrosoftOnlineServicesID = $actionContext.Data.userPrincipalName
    ResetPasswordOnNextLogon  = [bool]($actionContext.Data.passwordProfile.forceChangePasswordNextSignIn)
    Password                  = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $actionContext.Data.passwordProfile.password -AsPlainText -Force
}
```

### Governance Remarks
The import and reconciliation features of HelloID can be fully utilized with the Microsoft Entra EXO connector. However, there is a small difference in how the Disable and Delete actions are handled. Actions triggered by reconciliation use hardcoded fields instead of the configured field mapping, because there is no person context available during reconciliation. This limitation applies only to reconciliation, not to enforcement.

The properties updated during Delete and Disable actions triggered by reconciliation are shown below. If these defaults do not meet customer requirements, they can be easily adjusted in the script. A switch determines how the request body is created based on the origin, either `enforcement` or `reconciliation`. The enforcement option is dynamic and uses the field mapping, while the reconciliation option is hardcoded.

- `accountEnabled = $false`
- `HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled = $true`  *EXO only

### ExO PowerShell module

Within HelloID, version _3.5.1_ of the Exchange Online module is being used. https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.5.1

> [!NOTE]
> This module is provided via the HelloID cloud agent with a limited set of available cmdlets.

### Connect-ManagedExchangeOnline

`Connect-ManagedExchangeOnline` is a custom cmdlet used to establish the connection to Exchange Online. This cmdlet is only available within the HelloID cloud agent environment.

### Script flow

#### 1. Preparation

- Enables TLS 1.2 for secure HTTPS communication.
- Defines fallback properties for mailbox correlation between Entra and Exchange Online.

#### 2. Correlation Check

- Attempts to find an existing Entra account using a configured correlation field and value.
- If not found, attempts to locate the account using a fallback property (e.g., `givenName`).
- If multiple accounts are found in either step, the process fails.

#### 3. Exchange Online Mailbox Check (if enabled)

- If an Entra account is found, the script attempts to locate the associated Exchange Online mailbox using the `ExternalDirectoryObjectId`.
- If the mailbox is not found, and Exchange Online integration is required, an exception is thrown.

> [!NOTE]
> The update, disable and delete script skips actions if the mailbox is not found. This is to prevent errors when de license is already withdrawn.

#### 4. Manager Lookup (if configured)

- If `setManagerOnCreate` is enabled and a `ManagerAccount` reference is provided, it attempts to validate the manager's existence.
- If the manager account is not found (404), an exception is thrown.

#### 5. Determine Actions

- Based on account presence in Entra and ExO, determines the required actions:
  - **Entra only**: Create or correlate Entra account.
  - **Entra + ExO**: Create Exchange mailbox, update correlation value in Entra, update both Entra and ExO accounts.
  - **SetManager**: If required and configured.

#### 6. Execute Actions

Actions are executed in order:
- `CreateAccountEntra`: Creates the MS Entra account.
- `CreateAccountExo`: Creates an Exchange Online mailbox and sets the fallback property for Entra.
- `UpdateAccountEntraCorrelationValueAfterCreateMailbox`: Updates the Entra account with the correlation value after mailbox creation.
- `UpdateAccountEntra`: Updates user properties in the Entra account (excluding ExchangeOnline and passwordProfile).
- `UpdateAccountExo`: Updates mailbox properties in Exchange Online, with special handling to skip no-op updates.
- `CorrelateAccount`: Correlates both the MS Entra and Exchange Online account(s).
- `SetManager`: Placeholder for setting manager relationship, not implemented.
